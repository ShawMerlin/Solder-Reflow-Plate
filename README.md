# **Solder Reflow Plate - Fork** #

My name is Merlin Shaw and here are the improvements that I am adding to this amazing Project!!

Update 3/5/2022
- Utilizing the new V3 Circuit Design that AfterEarth (Christopher Halsall) just released.
- USB C PD Circuit added using a IP2721 and a Design by Brian Lough for his PS100 Flex-C-Friend.
- Created an adapter board that holds all the circuitry.  This can be attached to a base and the Seperate PCB Heat Plate attaches above it.
- Mounting holes on the adapter and the PCB Heat Plate align so that standoff's can be used to hold up the heat plate.
- Moved the circuitry down so that the OLED can lay flat against the PCB Board.

## As Seen On GreatScott! 

This project has recently featured on a DIY or BUY GreatScott! video.

## UPDATE!!!

Join the [DISCORD!](https://discord.gg/T9dxeRmY)

Checkout the new Ver 3.0 design. Very similar to Ver 2.4 but now comes with ATmega4809 as its availability is much better than the 328p at the moment. Code is still in development but the board designs are available in the Board Versions Folder.

## Versions

- 70mm x 50mm (Ver 2.4)
  - 12VDC (5A Minimum)
  - 5.5mm x 2.5mm Barrel Jack
  - 0.91" OLED Display
  - ATmega328p Microprocessor

- 70mm x 50mm (Ver 3.0) **NEW**
  - 12VDC (5A Minimum)
  - 5.5mm x 2.5mm Barrel Jack
  - 0.91" OLED Display
  - ATmega4809 Microprocessor

## About the Project

Like any good nerd does I've been expanding my hobby horizons.
I've gone from breadboard, to perf board, through-hole, to SMD, ever increasing circuit complexity and improving my knowledge.
But I've become frustrated with the difficulty of SMD soldering.
Regular soldering jogs small components and needs lots of flux.
Hot air damages plastics.
Hot plates are expensive and can be big wastes of space.

*"But you're a nerd"* I hear you cry, *"why don't you DIY a solution?"*.

[Electronoobs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjiVhIvGmRZixSzupD0sS9Q) shows a great DIY solution using an old clothes iron hot plate.
You can watch his video [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7blZigaaaA)
Have a go!

While I love this solution, I wanted to develop something smaller and more permanent.
Hence the Solder Reflow Plate was born, a PCB-based, MOSFET controlled heater, perfect for easily reflowing SMD components giving surprisingly professional results. Furthermore, these results are achieved without breaking the bank or taking up an enormous amount of desk space.

And so, this nerd bestows upon the world his project, fully open-source and hackable.
Here's hoping that it may be used to develop skills, build custom circuit boards, and make quality designs possible to all!

## Purchase

- Register your email address at [www.solderreflowplate.co.uk](https://www.solderreflowplate.co.uk) to know when it is available to buy!
- There is a worldwide shortage of ATmega328p Microcontrollers. I'm currently working on a small redesign for a more readily available chip.
- Purchase will be available soon!

That means it is entirely open-source, so you get access to everything! (just without warranty or liability)
Feel free to download, customise, hack, and commercialise to your nerdy heart's content.

Want the **easy** life?!
**Purchase** the default design above!
Its fully functional, cheaper than customising, and helps to feed the creator's caffeine addiction ðŸ™ƒ
